        "# Capstone Project - The Battle of the Neighborhoods: Open a Brazilian Restaurant in Miami\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion the  [IBM Data Science Professional Certificates](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science) in  [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org), you will find in this post an overview of my final capstone project.\n",
        "\n",
        "All details of this project are given in my Github repo and link can be found at the end of the post.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Introduction: Business Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "Miami, officially the City of Miami, is a metropolis located in southeastern Florida in the United States. It is the third most populous metropolis on the East coast of the United States, and it is the seventh largest in the country. The city is an economic powerhouse, serving as the financial and business capital of Latin America. The city has the third tallest skyline in the U.S. with over 300 high-rises, 55 of which exceed 491 ft (150 m).\n",
        "\n",
        "Miami is a major center and leader in finance, commerce, culture, arts, and international trade. The metro area is by far the largest urban economy in Florida and the 12th largest in the United States, with a GDP of $344.9 billion as of 2017. In 2020, Miami was classified as a Beta + level global city by the GaWC. In 2019, Miami ranked seventh in the United States and 31st among global cities in terms of business activity, human capital, information exchange, cultural experience, and political engagement. According to a 2018 UBS study of 77 world cities, the city was ranked as the third-richest in the United States and the eighth-richest in the world in terms of purchasing power. Miami is nicknamed the \"Capital of Latin America\" and is the largest city with a Cuban-American plurality.\n",
        "\n",
        "This final project explores the best locations for Brazilian restaurants throughout the city of Miami. As Miami is considered the \"Capital of Latin America\", it has a long tradition of receive many Latin visitors and many of them Brazilians. That's why potentially the owner of the new Brazilian restaurant can have great success and consistent profit. However, as with any business, opening a new restaurant requires serious considerations and is more complicated than it seems from the first glance. In particular, the location of the restaurant is one of the most important factors that will affect whether it will have success or a failure. So our project will attempt to answer the questions “Where should the investor open a Brazilian Restaurant?” and “Where should I go If I want great Brazilian food?”\n",
        " \n",
        "## Data\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to answer the above questions, data on Miami City neighborhoods, latitude, longitude, restaurants and categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "Miami City data containing the neighborhoods, latitudes, and longitudes will be obtained from the data source:  [Wikipedia.org - List of neighborhoods in Miami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighborhoods_in_Miami). But I used only the name of the neighborhoods.\n",
        "\n",
        "All data related to locations will be obtained via the Geocoder ArcGis library in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "All data related to locations of restaurants and categories will be obtained via the FourSquare API utilized via the Request library in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Methodology\n",
        "\n",
        "- Data with name of the neighborhoods will be collected from [Wikipedia.org - List of neighborhoods in Miami](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_neighborhoods_in_Miami) and cleaned and processed into a dataframe.\n",
        "\n",
        "- FourSquare API be used to locate all venues and then filtered by restaurants and categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Data will be sorted and counted based on categories.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Finally, the data will be visually assessed using graphing from Python libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "- After the classification by category, it is easy to identify which category (type of cuisine) has the greatest recurrence in the city of Miami.\n",
        "\n",
        "- The importance of grouping, K-means is a type of unsupervised learning and one of the popular methods of clustering unlabelled data into k clusters. One of the trickier tasks in clustering is identifying the appropriate number of clusters k.\n",
        "\n",
        "- In cluster analysis, the elbow method is a heuristic used in determining the number of clusters in a data set. The method consists of plotting the explained variation as a function of the number of clusters, and picking the elbow of the curve as the number of clusters to use. In our case approximately 4.5\n",
        "\n",
        "## Results and Discussion\n",
        "\n",
        "What is/are the best location(s) for Brazilian cuisine in Miami City? In what Neighborhood and/or borough should the investor open a Brazilian restaurant to have the best chance of being successful? Where would I go in Miami City to have the best Brazilian food?\n",
        "\n",
        "Well! i able to find out some interesting insights which might be useful to investor. Below I highlight some of them:\n",
        "\n",
        "\t- We only have two Brazilian restaurants in Miami.\n",
        "\t- It is interesting to test with a solution other than Fousqaure to verify data accuracy.\n",
        "\t- It is interesting to deepen the analysis and reading of the data by grouping to get more questions and answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This project of mine is focused on demonstrating my knowledge in the use of all techniques and also going through all stages.\n",
        "\n",
        "At all stages I wanted to be more illustrative.\n",
        "\n",
